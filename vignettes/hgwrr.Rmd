The package **hgwrr** is used to calibrate Hierarchical and Geographically Weighted Regression (HGWR) model on spatial data.
It requires the spatial hierarchical structure in the data; i.e., samples are grouped by their locations.
All the variables are either in the group level or sample level.
For the group-level variables, they can have fixed effects (globally constant) or spatially weighted effects (varying with the location).
For the sample-level variables, they can have fixed effects or random effects (varying among groups).
We note the fixed effects as $\beta$, the group-level spatially weighted (GLSW) effects as $\gamma$, and sample-level random (SLR) effects as $\mu$.
The HGWR model consists of these three kinds of effects and estimates the three kinds of effects considering the spatial heterogeneity.

```{r setup}
library(hgwrr)
```

# Usage

## Model calibration

To calibrate a HGWR model, use the function `hgwr()`.

```r
hgwr(
  formula, data, ..., bw = "CV",
  kernel = c("gaussian", "bisquared"),
  alpha = 0.01, eps_iter = 1e-6, eps_gradient = 1e-6,
  max_iters = 1e6, max_retries = 1e6,
  ml_type = c("D_Only", "D_Beta"), verbose = 0
)
```

The following is explanation of some important parameters.

### `formula`

This parameter specifies the model form.
Recall that the three kinds of effects are GLSW, fixed, and SLR effects.
They are specified in different parts of the formula.

```r
response ~ L(GLSW) + fixed + (SLR | group)
```

In the formula, `L()` is used to mark some effects as GLSW effects, and `( | group)` is used to set the SLR effects and grouping indicator.
Only group-level variables can have GLSW effects.

### `data`

**`sf` objects**

From version 0.3-1, this parameter supports `sf` objects.
In this case, no further arguments in `...` are required.
Here is an example.

```{r}
data(wuhan.hp)
m_sf <- hgwr(
  formula = Price ~ L(d.Water + d.Commercial) + BuildingArea + (Floor.High | group),
  data = wuhan.hp,
  bw = 299
)
```

**`data.frame` objects**

If the data is a normal `data.frame` object, an extra argument `coords` is required to specify the coordinates of each group.
Note that the row order of `coords` needs to match that of the `group` variable.
Here is an example.

```{r}
data(multisampling)
m_df <- hgwr(
  formula = y ~ L(g1 + g2) + x1 + (z1 | group),
  data = multisampling$data,
  coords = multisampling$coords
)
```

### `bw` and `kernel`

Argument `bw` is the bandwidth used to estimate GLSW effects.
It can be either of the following options:

- A integer value representing the number of nearest neighbours.
- `"CV"` letting the algorithm select one.

Argument `kernel` is the kernel function used to estimate GLSW effects.
Currently, there are only two choices: `"gaussian"` and `"bisquared"`.

## Results

The output of returned object of `hgwr()` shows the estimates of the effects.

```{r}
m_sf
```

And the `summary()` method shows some diagnostic information.

```{r}
summary(m_sf)
```

Some other methods are provided.

```{r}
head(coef(m_sf))
head(fitted(m_sf))
head(residuals(m_sf))
```
