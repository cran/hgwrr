Description: This model divides coefficients into three types,
        i.e., local fixed effects, global fixed effects, and random effects (Hu et al., 2022)<doi:10.1177/23998083211063885>.
        If data have spatial hierarchical structures (especially are overlapping on some locations),
        it is worth trying this model to reach better fitness.
